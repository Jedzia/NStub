=========================

To make the debug Information accessible from a source server you 
need:
* The Debugging Tools for Windows. 
  ( from http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/DevTools/Debugging/default.mspx)
* Installed Perl ( i use Active Perl https://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads/)
* A svn client ( http://www.open.collab.net/downloads/subversion/ )
* The sources as part of a checked out working copy with open access to the 
  svn repository like SourceForge, your own server or another provider.

Set the Perl Variable to your executable: <Perl>c:\perl\perl\bin\perl.exe</Perl>.
Set the SourceServerIndexerPath to the srcsrv directory, e.g.
$(ProgramFiles)\Debugging Tools for Windows (x86)\srcsrv. Then adjust the settings
in your srcsrv.ini file. Possibly you have to set the correct path to your svn
executable.
Once set up correctly you can index your pdb's with msbuild /t:BuildSourceServerIndex.


Set
	<!--Build the Source Server Index-->
	<Target Name="BuildSourceServerIndex" DependsOnTargets="CreateBuildDir" Condition="false">

to true.

run
Build>msbuild /t:BuildSourceServerIndex
